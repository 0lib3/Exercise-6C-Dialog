Hey man, I forgot what the definition of orthogonal vectors is. Mind helping a cube out?
-> choices
== choices ==
    * No.
        - - - If you don't help me I'm going to kill you.
        -> choices
    * Vectors are orthogonal to each other when the dot product of u and v are equivalent to zero.
        - - - Thanks man, you're a lifesaver... your own life...
    
    - See you at the next exam, buddy!
        -> END
